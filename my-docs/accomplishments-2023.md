1. Components are getting stamped by Services 
2. Establishing JIRA Automation system with ChatGPT in Snowflake 
3. Build statuses to Snowflake: 
    3.1 Built this program in python. Gaurav contributed. Ishwinder created AWS Batch where we can launch any of our internal programs. 
4. Team re-organisation 
5. Skill metric 
6. TREE Program establishment 
7. Intervention Analytics Delivery 
8. TMA Delivery 
9. Snowflake Migration : Migration Guide + Automation: Established process
10. Onboarding Guide resulting in less errors 
11. Assessments Automation process: Issues coming to Pinnacle Team 
12. Proposed CAPA Analysis process for the whole team to bring down incoming across components : need to set in action
13. Dashboard on backlog analysis. Clearly identify issues longer than 300+ days and provide analysis by components to be taken up by teams. 
13. No Fix version analysis continued and follow up. Setup of Vaidehi role to work with support. Enrollment documents created similarly other components. 
    13.1: Analysis by who is reporting the issues. In snowflake created the data and mapped all reporters to departments to get this out making analysis easy on these issues. 



This quarter we have Delivered about 48 User Stories for TMA amounting to 182 Story points worth of work. 
Teams delivered 45 user stories for Intervention Analytics with about 181 (Largest contribution by Othello to 23.9.0.0) 
42 User stories are delivered under Production Support - H2 amoutning to 172 story points worth of effort 
31 new content User stories are delivered with 136 story points of work. 
Data Ninja team delivered 31 user stories amounting to 115 story points of work. 
Apart from this 49 other user stories are delivered across other epics with about 187 story points. 
Teams delivered 107 Bugs amounting to 170 story points that came from external parties such as technical support and cloudops teams. 


I have driven some of the changes such as snowflake migration guide and making it like code so that chances of errors by snowstorm team is reduced. 

We have brought in our data in snowflake with many augmented analytics fields such as time tickets takes during development, total cycle times, flagged times for tickets, department from where tickets are logged. Data is also brought from git and confluence to identify contributions by teams and team members to these places. 



Collaboration with support teams are established and support team is stamping components and are also providing more troubleshooting steps before bringing issues to engineering. 



We have identified a good number of issues logged by QA in Bronze and we need to set better quality standards such that not so many issues are logged by QA Team since these are mostly regression issues caused by new development that is not tested well before merging code to bronze. 



Created an Awards process that will help teams identify their top stars and really appreciate individuals who are able to contribute more towards product.
