- For a team look across last 6 sprints (Q2)
- Look for under which EPICs work is performed by team 
- How much of this work is for new enhancements vs bug fixes

Analysis for bug fixes: 
- in bug fixes, how much work went under no fix version
- in bug fixes, under which components team fixed issues
- what is the patter of these issues, what are the CAPA for such issues such that these issues do not occur again 
- which components team can own end to end in coming quarter. which training is needed 
- set goals for owning components, calculate inflow and bring about improvement in this inflow 

Analysis for User Stories 


Individual Analysis 

### Metrics that should matter: 
1. in a period lets say 6 months. for a team. Total story points done. 
2. Divide story points in user stories and bugs 
3. Slice that work into bugs solved for production customers and within that how many have code changes 
4. For user stories, categorize under which EPICs these belong to and what business impact these stories are able to create. (how much epics are able to move forward)
5. Correlate this with dev cycle time effort. and that with story points and git checkins.
