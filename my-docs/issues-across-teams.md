Shivani a 1-1: 
1. How can we fix such that P1s are P1s and P0s are P0s. 
2. How can we fix one PO for each scrum team. 
3. Smaller EPICs, End dates and one epic going to one team (we are ready to collaborate)
4. Component wise ownership 
5. Support engineering collaboration - india and US participation. 
6. Content work is ongoing work. and lot of effort goes in those tickets. i can provide numbers if that can help in justifying that work and effort. 
7. We are having support collaboration calls. Can we have respective product owners in these calls. 


Topics for D: 
1. No Fix Version and RCA Process. Clear list of Actions Taken by Each Team. Git connect with JIRA. 
2. process for ticket status, ready for release to close and tight monitoring or automation.. --> TPO:  
3. Metric for Inflow reduction: Baseline 
4. Cloudops Responsibilities and Accountabilities: Basic automations, cloud infrastructure, whats going wrong in infra plus what needs to be improved can come from them. Proper handover process between engineering and cloudops should be established. 
5. Collaboration with Support need product involvement formally. We can have component wise ownership for POs as well and then let them drive the inflow in each area. 
6. How can we know in engineering which customrs / issues are of highest priority. we are not using P0/P1/P2s properly in uihn. 
7. Fixing Product owner for a team. Currently, its shared and more than 1 product owners is involved in one team and one epic is spread across multiple teams. 
8. Content work is ongoing work. and lot of effort goes in those tickets. i can provide numbers if that can help in justifying that work and effort. 
6. Product side process improvements. Refinements / technical knowledge and collaboration. at times, product pushes for tickets without getting refined and then later on teams are struggling with velocity and other metrics. if teams do not accept tickets, no body should push it down to them to accept the tickets. i am pushing from my side but this feedback has to go to product also. 
5. Improve salesforce integration in jira and get customer name in a field in jira itself to do customer level analysis of jira tickets.


VS: 
- Tickets stay too long in dev in progress. Issues are not resolved. Rather sometimes we close the issue and log another issue. This kind of malpractice to make things look good causes breach of trust to me. A recent example is : https://powerschoolgroup.atlassian.net/browse/UIHN-57643 It stayed for more than 60 days in dev in progress. once i started following up in few days it was closed with no real resolution. rather a new ticket was mentioned as a follow up. To me, senior resources in team unable to solve issues for so long is a problem for team under his leadership. 
- Topics that i disseminate to this group does not trickle down. There are many instances when i speak to the team and they are unaware of the process changes or improvements we discuss at leadership levels. 
- There are instances when i speak to team and ask what topics are being discussed in your 1-1 with your manager and they tell me that they have not had their 1-1 for a while. While part of my coaching to him, i have given him detail documentation on how to conduct 1-1s. This was my conversation with Akash while i was driving back with him from an office outing. 
- Team has complaint time over time that he does not have time for them. He is too busy in solving problems at his level. 
- he did not have a good handle on how much time a ticket should take and how much time engineers are taking. because of that engineers keep working on many tickets and there is no progress across. this reflects into cycle times of ticket and highly blocked tickets which was very high for his teams compared to others.

Meeting with Devendra Wrap up:
