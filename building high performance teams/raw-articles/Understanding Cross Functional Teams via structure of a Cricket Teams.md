In my previous article, we explored the initial steps of envisioning your teams as their own startups by structuring them as cross-functional units. Today, let’s take that analogy further by analyzing how a cricket team is organized and structured. Is it a cross-functional team ? If yes, what are the benefits vs what are the alternate ways it could be structured and organized.

### **Skills Required to form a Cricket Team**

A Cricket team is composed of people with skills majorly batting, bowling, fielding and wicketkeeping. Within each skills there are expertise such as openers, middle-order batting, end-game, fast bowlers, spin bowlers, special skill bowlers, fielders who are great at fielding at short distances vs those who are good at taking catches and long distance throw etc. So if you observe its composed of many skills each of which when arranged in a team can make a huge difference in how the team will perform. 

### **Structure of a Cricket Team** 

From above explanation it should be clear that cricket team is organized as a cross-functional skill. Let’s imagine if cricket games were organized as skill based teams then there would be a team or an organization of batters, a separate organization and hierarchy of bowlers, fielders etc. Now, a game will be arranged and team will have multiple ‘managers’. Batters will have their own manager who will monitor their game. Bowlers will have their own manager. Fielding might remain left over. 

Each manager will be observing performance of their own players and will probably have their own metrics to justify that their players are doing the best in the game. A captain (like a scrum master) would be powerless in such a structure and metrics to observe team metric may be absent from the play. End of the day, each individual may do their jobs well but matches may go in any direction. 

If we further compare this with organizations then probably there is no clear competitor identified and in the end there is no fun and excitement that is been derived from these games. 

Well this may paint a picture why in an organization, teams structured as skill based teams a scrum team sucks. When engineers are not happy and team play is not exciting the whole process becomes uninteresting. And slowly the productivity or final outcomes take a hit. When teams become non-competitive then the whole organization becomes unfit for the competition as well. Leading to a down fall of the organization which was probably functioning as a team when it was small in its size and not so many silos were created. 

### Scrum Team as a Cross Functional Team 

In a scrum team which is organized as cross functional team, the captain of the team (scrum master) brings players with different skills (coding, testing, devops, designing, ui/ux, requirement creator (product owner), cloud, performance engineer etc) together required to get the work done. 

In a cross functional team, engineers are cross skilled. Just like in a cricket team every player bats and fields. Fielding is a shared responsibility. Each player develops multiple skills and identifies their strength and weaknesses very well. A captain understand strengths and weakness of each player and manipulates these during the play to get the best result. During the play team players are completely in command of the captain (and themselves) and are focused on winning the game. (not individual metrics) 

In such a team while each individual player and their skills are important, the team play as such is lot more than that. Its how the players interact with each other and compensate each other to get the best outcome. 

In a scrum team structured as cross functional team, team has all capabilities and is responsible to take the game to the end. i.e. review requirements, write code, test it and then deploy on production and observe this code. Team iterates from customer experiences making the experience better. 

A cross functional high performing team has clear goals that are customer oriented. Cross functional team is as close to customers as possible and understand how they are impacting experience of their customers. Team is empowered as a whole and is trusted for making the right decisions. Its expected to learn from its mistakes and adjust itself to make its game better from each sprint it executes. 

### Role of Senior Leader in such an environment

While role of the captain is to understand the team players and arrange them in such a way that team is able to deliver fast with high quality, role of senior leaders in such an organization is to provide and create an environment where such teams can operate and thrive. 

They need to build cross functional teams and remove unnecessary barriers of multiple hierarchies and departments and facilitate whole team to come together as a cross functional team with a single focus and goal that is to delight their customers with their service. 

Senior leadership team need to be ‘Serving leaders’ to the teams providing the teams whatever they need to be successful. e.g. if team needs cross trainings of its players for certain skills leadership team should enable that. In case team does not have required accesses to be able to fully deploy the solutions leadership team should enable such that team can do its end to end work. SLT should ensure that team is empowered and then they should trust the team for making right decisions towards their success. SLT should also act like a coach by periodically reviewing the outcomes of the team and providing guidance to teams as to what adjustments can lead them to better success. 

### Importance of Setting Clear and Right Goals in such an environment

One of the key difference between a sports team and scrum team is that sports team has a clear opponent and thus a clear goal. In a scrum team especially one that is sitting far away from its customers (not because of their geographical distance but due to waterfall model), team does not know what is it aiming at. Team does not know when it was successful vs when it failed. It does not have clarity towards what they need to be targeting. 

In such scenarios crafting goals and responsibilities for teams is very crucial and it requires some deep thinking about its objectives. 

### Create goals related Customer Experiences

Most business applications are about enabling its users to be able to do their functions easily and efffectively. e.g. in a school application we focus on how an admin can enroll a student easily. How a teacher and create and assignment or grade it etc. When you are using a retail site, how user searches for the products its looking for and then how it adds to a cart or purchases the product. If teams goals can be aligned with either enabling or improving these experiences then teams have a simple way to measure the progress they are able to make. In case teams can be provided with few competitor products, how these products are achieving the same, now teams focused on each of these steps will start improving each of these experiences. This will give a clear focus to the team and a way to measure their progress. Product owners and managers can perform some A/B testing on new features or run some tests on beta features collecting valuable customer feedback about their experiences. In this way each part of the application can start to become better over a period of time. 

For this reason, providing each team some ‘scope’ or a ‘charter’ can be a good process to build respective smaller area expertise in the team. This scope of charter provides an area of application that team is expected to make better. Team can also be provided a focus to add some new features and then work on improving the experience of using that feature for their set of users. 

In this way, by creating a cross functional team that is capable of building end to end features and providing them a clear scope and area of application where they are expected to operate these teams can operate like their own startups. These teams can have some virtual revenue numbers or customer experience number that they are evaluated upon for the RoI of these teams. 

In the world of software application, these applications are always on path of continuous improvement. iPhone applications are not inherently changing but how users interact with iphone has continuously improved with advent of new technologies , features , hardware improvements etc. Hence a team understanding how to improve existing features is very important for software teams. 

  

**Conclusion**

From the above examples and illustrations, i hope it is clear that how a scrum team that is not arranged as cross functional team and is formed from multiple silos can be very inefficient. When teams are inefficient, team players are unhappy and over a period of time it leads to an uproductive environment. Although a scrum team is not akin to cricket team in some ways, however drawing these parallels should enlighten as how creating a ‘true team’ environment in scrum team and enabling it to be a full delivery team owning its complete destiny and empowering it to make its own decisions and learn from its experiences can lead to a thriving organization.

In my previous article, we explored the initial steps of envisioning your teams as their own startups by structuring them as cross-functional units. Today, let’s understand a cross functional team structure by comparing it with that of a cricket team. Is it a cross-functional team ? If yes, what are the benefits vs what are the alternate ways it could be structured and organized.

### **Skills Required to form a Cricket Team**
A Cricket team is composed of people with skills majorly batting, bowling, fielding and wicketkeeping. Within each skills there are expertise such as openers, middle-order batting, end-game, fast bowlers, spin bowlers, special skill bowlers, fielders who are great at fielding at short distances vs those who are good at taking catches and long distance throw etc. So if you observe its composed of many skills each of which when arranged in a team can make a huge difference in how the team will perform.

### **Structure of a Cricket Team** 
By considering each skill as a separate function of its own, A cricket team is inherently structured as a cross-functional team. The Team 'delivers' the 'customer delight' (by making maximum runs or getting opponent out with minimum runs or beating the opponent score in minimum overs) by playing the whole game together as a team. While how each player contributes to the game is important, the end goal is to produce and entertaining game and produce victory. Teamwork takes precedence over individual contribution. Also, how captain of the team utilizes multiple skills and strengths of each player during the dynamic play , plays a vital role in final outcome of the game (scoring maximum runs or getting the opponent out with minimum runs). Dynamics of the game changes during every play and each player contributes differently in each game. While each player may be trained separately by its own skill expert, during the play they forget their own silos and focus on the game as a team. During the game interaction between the players, communication, coordination and adaptation to different situation plays as important a role as capabilities of each player. By having some player skilled in multiple skills they back each other up. E.g. in case top order batsman gets out early the middle-order and end-game players take the onus of taking the game to the end. For each ball how each player should be placed can impact the outcome of the game. Fielding is taken as a shared responsibility by all even though there are few highly skilled expert fielders who play a vital role in stopping crucial runs. 
A cross functional structure of the team, a multi-skilled captain with good leadership skills and multi-skilled players make the whole game very interesting and becomes a decisive factor in which team will be victorious. A great team which is able to create all these balance, creates the chances of winning in most odds. 

### Let's examine what happens in a scrum Team and what learnings can be applied here
No analogy is perfect. However, by comparing a scrum team and cricket team structure and game dynamics can give very useful insights into how to tacklet various situations that arise in day to day situations of a scrum team. 

Much like a cricket team, a scrum team is organised as a cross-functional team with product owners, quality engineers, developers (back-end, front-end, different programming languages experts) as its core members while team may have some 'consultants' available to it for helping with special type of work. While each of these individuals have well defined roles and are trained by their own leaders and teachers, when it comes to completing the sprint, the team should comes together as a one team and operates under guidance of unified leadership of a captain which is much like scrum master whose single goal should be to complete the sprint as per its commitment with highest quality standards of the stories in the sprint. 

Very similar to cricket game, team faces many dynamic situations during the sprint. such as high priority customer defects or evolution in requirements as engineers start working on the stories. Some new hurdles are found such as technical difficulties or blockers. Team may find work requiring more effort than originally estimated as the work makes more progress. Since software development work is highly innovative work the real work unfolds many surprises during the sprint. A skillfull scrum master should in such cases navigate the whole sprint by utilizing skills of various team members and creating a teamwork environment where everyone pitches into sharing the responsibility of the work that team has committed. The teamwork in this case should take priority over each individual work. 

Team in first place should be aware of team goal. Like cricket game, while individual contribution is important, the team goal takes precedence over individual goals. Its possible that one member is not able to complete as much work as it planned while other player is able to complete its work much earlier. In such cases these players should come to rescue of each other and complete the work that would otherwise get spilled over. A senior member may have to sacrifice some of its own work and help a junior member in unblocking and solving their problems. 

Like in cricket, every member can do everything though they are expert in their own area, in a scrum team members should be able to work on multiple skill areas. This way team is not bottlenecked by I-shape players. Scrum master and coaches over a period of time develop such T and X shaped individuals. 

Another corollary that i find very interesting is Fielding. To me, fielding is very similar to quality or testing of the tickets. While most scrum teams have a dedicated tester in the team, often tester gets burdened with all the tickets that other engineers are producing and it alone finds it difficult to complete testing. Just like fielding is a shared responsibility, scrum team should take testing as a shared responsiblity. While 'expert tester' should bring its deep knowledge about testing a feature in form of helping each player create test scenarios, its each engineer who should take accountability of their tickets and get the testing done. 

In the end, completion of the sprint with high quality is a shared responsibility and shared success of team. Leaders should act like coaches and should serve the team (literally being like waterman in cricket team). Leader of each organization such as product, qa and engineering managers should observe the sprints closely and coach team in doing their work better. 


**Conclusion**
As we mentioned earlier, no analogy is perfect and so is the case with cricket team or any sports team with sprint team. However, i have found it very insightful by comparing situations a scrum team faces with how a cricket team or a sports team would handle the same. In most cases i am able to find good solutions or hints towards solving these riddles. 

Have you faced any peculiar situations during your sprints. Would you like to compare that with a similar situation a cricket team faces and does it provides you an insightful solution ? If yes, pls share your experiences or situations that has arised in your sprint teams. Lets learn from each others experiences.

In my previous article, we explored the initial steps of envisioning your teams as their own startups by structuring them as cross-functional units. Today, let’s delve deeper into understanding a cross-functional team structure by drawing an insightful comparison with that of a cricket team. Is it truly a cross-functional team? If yes, what are the benefits, and how could it be structured and organized differently?

Skills Required to Form a Cricket Team
A cricket team is composed of individuals with diverse skills including batting, bowling, fielding, and wicket-keeping. Within these skills, there are further specializations such as openers, middle-order batting, end-game strategies, fast bowlers, spin bowlers, and fielders adept at short distances versus those proficient in catching and long-distance throws. This composition of varied skills, when synergized within a team, significantly influences the team's performance.

Structure of a Cricket Team
By recognizing each skill as a distinct function, a cricket team epitomizes a cross-functional team. The team aims to 'deliver' 'customer delight' by scoring maximum runs, minimizing opponent runs, or surpassing the opponent's score in the least number of overs, all achieved through cohesive teamwork. The essence of teamwork supersedes individual contributions, with the captain's role in leveraging each player's skills and strengths during dynamic gameplay being crucial to the game's outcome. The game's dynamics evolve with each play, demanding different contributions from each player. This necessitates a focus on team objectives over individual silos, with communication, coordination, and adaptation to varying situations being as critical as the players' capabilities. The presence of players skilled in multiple areas enhances the team's resilience, exemplifying the importance of a cross-functional structure, leadership, and versatility in achieving victory.

Learning from Scrum Teams
Drawing parallels between cricket teams and scrum teams offers valuable insights into managing diverse situations that arise in the agile environment. Like a cricket team, a scrum team is organized as a cross-functional unit comprising product owners, quality engineers, developers (back-end, front-end, various programming languages experts), and occasionally 'consultants' for specialized tasks. Under the unified leadership of a scrum master, akin to a cricket captain, the team strives to complete sprints with the highest quality standards.

Dynamic challenges such as high-priority customer defects, evolving requirements, technical difficulties, and underestimated efforts are common in sprints. A skilled scrum master navigates these challenges by fostering a teamwork environment where responsibilities are shared, mirroring the cricket field's collaborative spirit. The concept of fielding in cricket is analogous to quality assurance in scrum teams, emphasizing shared responsibility for quality and testing. This approach not only alleviates the burden on individual testers but also ensures collective accountability for sprint completion.

Conclusion While no analogy is perfect, comparing a scrum team's challenges with those faced by a cricket team provides practical solutions and insights. This comparison encourages us to view problems through a different lens, often leading to innovative solutions.

I invite you to share your experiences with cross-functional teams, particularly any unique challenges or situations you've encountered during sprints. Have you found comparing these to a cricket team's approach helpful in finding solutions? Let's learn from each other's experiences and continue to enhance our understanding of cross-functional teams.
