In my previous articles i have talked about importance of establishing cross functional structure in your team, taking some inspirations from cricket teams and then how cross skilling can help establish a team that is truly independent and can deliver a set of features independently to customers. 

The next challenge that confronts leaders on this journey is for scaling products or projects that starts to become very large over a period of time. A product that started with 10-15 engineers now needs 50+ engineers. How do you scale agile across these teams and still keep the productivity high as it was in earlier phases is a big challenge that many software companies face today. 

In my own career I would not shy from stating that i initially struggled managing large teams working a single product or a project. If this is the challenge your organization or you as a leader is facing then i hope this article will help you in solving this puzzle. 

Before we dwelve deeper into this, i would like to go back to principles and manifesto of agile and some of the fundamental questions you should ask as leaders. 

Why did you choose Agile ? What is the outcome you prefer from lets say 10 teams working on a single product as Agile teams ? 
Somewhere i feel that as the organizations and projects get large, they get lost in the mechanics of Agile. which is doing the scrum, daily standups, maintaining product backlogs etc. However, in essence teams are still delivering mega releases once in a month or once in two months with thousands if not millions of lines of code getting delivered in this major releases. Somewhere in this process if you zoom out you will see that organizations have increased their quotient of waterfallishness in the process. The releases are still very big, these require multiple rounds of testing and towards the end of the release teams are really not working on new features. Also, teams have so high dependencies on each other that when there are issues found in the release it takes longer period of time to identify where the issues are and what caused those issues. Forget about ability to release the software to slowly to a large customer base and forget about ability to rollback changes. Its a big bang release with high impact and something Agile principles should have helped you to avoid getting into. 

To me, the above scenario is not where you wanted to be and you expected Agile to help you in that. However, this did not become possible because even though your teams are following mecanics of agile, they are really not following the core principles of agile. They are truly not agile. 

To me, Agility means being able to ship software changes in as small increments as possible. 'Ability' is the key word. Does not mean you release everything in small increments. The reason you created 10 scrum teams for 50 engineers should have been so that each team can deliver their own changes as and when they intend to. Rather than all 50 engineers having to wait for the big release and wait to learn from each release. 

The purpose of Agile practices is to be able to release frequently in smaller increments and for each team to learn as quickly as possible from their experiments so that they can iterate over these features to make these better. Teams also need instrumentation in place where they can act like a startup. Which means teams can release a small feature to smaller set of customers before rolling it out to a larger set of customers. 

To me, unless you are enabling these mechanisms in your software delivery process, you are not moving towards Agile. Your teams are only following the motions and not really truly practicing agile. 

This means, there are some pre-requisite that you need to work upon before you can scale multiple teams working on the same product. This is the investment that you need to make in order to get to a state where you can deal at a larger scale for your product. 

Pre-requisite to Scaling Agile for larger projects/products: 
- High amount of DevOps as a culture and CICD Automations. 
- Good level of identified separation of concern in your services
	- In a product in order to assign these to different teams for a longer period where they can work on part of these pieces of software as separate products. 



Principle 1: What is your goal ? 
While establishing multiple teams, organizations should ask these questions. Why are they establishing multiple teams or so called scrum teams. Why not just create one large team and let the whole team deliver what features they need. 

Well the constraint here comes is that teams can only function when they are 2 pizza size teams. This is where humans can communicate effectively within this size and team meetings can be conducted effectively. This also gives a structure where you have one team lead for each team, a shared engineering manager and a dedicated product owner. 

So now, that we know we cannot function as one large team we must break this down into smaller teams of two pizza team, how can we set boundaries of these teams so that these teams do not clash with each other quite often. This takes us to second principle. 

Principle 2: Teams should be able to function as independently from each other as possible. 

Key concepts: Autonomy. 
- Autonomy: 
	- Mini-Startups 
- "How" Autonomy: (Team choose their own process)
	- When they run their standup 
	- Which flavor of agile they use (some use kanban or scrum or they switch)
- Ownership
	- Dedicated product owner 
	- Agile coach 
	- 
- Autonomy to Build what teams want to 
	- Influence autonomy 
	- Each person in a team is an idea person. Mutual Respect. 
- Release autonomy 
- A Mission 
	- Every squad has a mission. They are building a product (a set of features): Who is benefited from these features and what are the benefits. 
- Org Support 
- Build and Improve over long period of time 
- Metrics for measuring success: 
	- Value is the only metric that you should depend upon 
	- Think it -> Build it -> Ship it -> Tweak It 
	- Blue Green Releases 
	- Be data driven and success is based on data 
- Moving from Squads to Tribes 
	- < 50 People 
	- Same mission across squads. 
	- Co-located 
	- scrum of scrum on demand 
- Chapter 
	- horizontal : squads.

Agile Organizations resist getting into technical designs and architectures earlier in the cycle of projects while scaling challenge of agile requires someone to understand the architecture of the product.
