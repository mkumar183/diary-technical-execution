In my previous article, we explored the initial steps of envisioning your teams as their own startups by structuring them as cross-functional units. Today, let’s take that analogy further by analyzing how a cricket team is organized and structured. Is it a cross-functional team ? If yes, what are the benefits vs what are the alternate ways it could be structured and organized.

### **Skills Required to form a Cricket Team**

A Cricket team is composed of people with skills majorly batting, bowling, fielding and wicketkeeping. Within each skills there are expertise such as openers, middle-order batting, end-game, fast bowlers, spin bowlers, special skill bowlers, fielders who are great at fielding at short distances vs those who are good at taking catches and long distance throw etc. So if you observe its composed of many skills each of which when arranged in a team can make a huge difference in how the team will perform. 

### **Structure of a Cricket Team** 

From above explanation it should be clear that cricket team is organized as a cross-functional skill. Let’s imagine if cricket games were organized as skill based teams then there would be a team or an organization of batters, a separate organization and hierarchy of bowlers, fielders etc. Now, a game will be arranged and team will have multiple ‘managers’. Batters will have their own manager who will monitor their game. Bowlers will have their own manager. Fielding might remain left over. 

Each manager will be observing performance of their own players and will probably have their own metrics to justify that their players are doing the best in the game. A captain (like a scrum master) would be powerless in such a structure and metrics to observe team metric may be absent from the play. End of the day, each individual may do their jobs well but matches may go in any direction. 

If we further compare this with organizations then probably there is no clear competitor identified and in the end there is no fun and excitement that is been derived from these games. 

Well this may paint a picture why in an organization, teams structured as skill based teams a scrum team sucks. When engineers are not happy and team play is not exciting the whole process becomes uninteresting. And slowly the productivity or final outcomes take a hit. When teams become non-competitive then the whole organization becomes unfit for the competition as well. Leading to a down fall of the organization which was probably functioning as a team when it was small in its size and not so many silos were created. 

### Scrum Team as a Cross Functional Team 

In a scrum team which is organized as cross functional team, the captain of the team (scrum master) brings players with different skills (coding, testing, devops, designing, ui/ux, requirement creator (product owner), cloud, performance engineer etc) together required to get the work done. 

In a cross functional team, engineers are cross skilled. Just like in a cricket team every player bats and fields. Fielding is a shared responsibility. Each player develops multiple skills and identifies their strength and weaknesses very well. A captain understand strengths and weakness of each player and manipulates these during the play to get the best result. During the play team players are completely in command of the captain (and themselves) and are focused on winning the game. (not individual metrics) 

In such a team while each individual player and their skills are important, the team play as such is lot more than that. Its how the players interact with each other and compensate each other to get the best outcome. 

In a scrum team structured as cross functional team, team has all capabilities and is responsible to take the game to the end. i.e. review requirements, write code, test it and then deploy on production and observe this code. Team iterates from customer experiences making the experience better. 

A cross functional high performing team has clear goals that are customer oriented. Cross functional team is as close to customers as possible and understand how they are impacting experience of their customers. Team is empowered as a whole and is trusted for making the right decisions. Its expected to learn from its mistakes and adjust itself to make its game better from each sprint it executes. 

### Role of Senior Leader in such an environment

While role of the captain is to understand the team players and arrange them in such a way that team is able to deliver fast with high quality, role of senior leaders in such an organization is to provide and create an environment where such teams can operate and thrive. 

They need to build cross functional teams and remove unnecessary barriers of multiple hierarchies and departments and facilitate whole team to come together as a cross functional team with a single focus and goal that is to delight their customers with their service. 

Senior leadership team need to be ‘Serving leaders’ to the teams providing the teams whatever they need to be successful. e.g. if team needs cross trainings of its players for certain skills leadership team should enable that. In case team does not have required accesses to be able to fully deploy the solutions leadership team should enable such that team can do its end to end work. SLT should ensure that team is empowered and then they should trust the team for making right decisions towards their success. SLT should also act like a coach by periodically reviewing the outcomes of the team and providing guidance to teams as to what adjustments can lead them to better success. 

### Importance of Setting Clear and Right Goals in such an environment

One of the key difference between a sports team and scrum team is that sports team has a clear opponent and thus a clear goal. In a scrum team especially one that is sitting far away from its customers (not because of their geographical distance but due to waterfall model), team does not know what is it aiming at. Team does not know when it was successful vs when it failed. It does not have clarity towards what they need to be targeting. 

In such scenarios crafting goals and responsibilities for teams is very crucial and it requires some deep thinking about its objectives. 

### Create goals related Customer Experiences

Most business applications are about enabling its users to be able to do their functions easily and efffectively. e.g. in a school application we focus on how an admin can enroll a student easily. How a teacher and create and assignment or grade it etc. When you are using a retail site, how user searches for the products its looking for and then how it adds to a cart or purchases the product. If teams goals can be aligned with either enabling or improving these experiences then teams have a simple way to measure the progress they are able to make. In case teams can be provided with few competitor products, how these products are achieving the same, now teams focused on each of these steps will start improving each of these experiences. This will give a clear focus to the team and a way to measure their progress. Product owners and managers can perform some A/B testing on new features or run some tests on beta features collecting valuable customer feedback about their experiences. In this way each part of the application can start to become better over a period of time. 

For this reason, providing each team some ‘scope’ or a ‘charter’ can be a good process to build respective smaller area expertise in the team. This scope of charter provides an area of application that team is expected to make better. Team can also be provided a focus to add some new features and then work on improving the experience of using that feature for their set of users. 

In this way, by creating a cross functional team that is capable of building end to end features and providing them a clear scope and area of application where they are expected to operate these teams can operate like their own startups. These teams can have some virtual revenue numbers or customer experience number that they are evaluated upon for the RoI of these teams. 

In the world of software application, these applications are always on path of continuous improvement. iPhone applications are not inherently changing but how users interact with iphone has continuously improved with advent of new technologies , features , hardware improvements etc. Hence a team understanding how to improve existing features is very important for software teams. 

  

**Conclusion**

From the above examples and illustrations, i hope it is clear that how a scrum team that is not arranged as cross functional team and is formed from multiple silos can be very inefficient. When teams are inefficient, team players are unhappy and over a period of time it leads to an uproductive environment. Although a scrum team is not akin to cricket team in some ways, however drawing these parallels should enlighten as how creating a ‘true team’ environment in scrum team and enabling it to be a full delivery team owning its complete destiny and empowering it to make its own decisions and learn from its experiences can lead to a thriving organization.
