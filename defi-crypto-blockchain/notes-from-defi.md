DeFi is not a single product or company, but a range of financial services which emulates traditional financial industries, including banking, insurance, bonds, money markets and more. DeFi Dapps enable users to combine these services to achieve desired financial goals. It is often called money LEGOs
due to its composability. 

 Dapps

For DeFi Dapps to work, a collateral locked into smart contracts is usually required. The cumulative collateral locked in DeFi Dapps is often referred to as the Total Value Locked, which serves as a growth indicator of the DeFi ecosystem. In our earlier edition, we highlighted that the Total Value Locked
at the start of 2019 measured around $275 million and reached a high of $1.2 billion in February 2020. As of April 2021, the Total Value Locked is a staggering $67 billion in Ethereum alone which goes to show how far we have come. This does not
even include other blockchain networks such as Binance, Solana, and others. The Total Value Locked for all the chains collectively adds up to $86 billion. 

Currently, most DeFi dapps are sitting in the semi-decentralized category. You may read more on the various decentralization components in Kyle Kistnerâ€™s article in the Recommended Readings.

9 Major Categories of Defi: 
1. StableCoins. 
2. Lending and Borrowing.
3. Exchanges
4. Derivatives: A derivative is a contract whose value is derived from another underlying asset such as stocks, commodities, currencies, indexes, bonds, or interest rates. Traders can use derivatives to hedge their positions and decrease their
risk in any particular trade. For example, imagine you are a glove manufacturer and want to hedge yourself from an unexpected increase in rubber price. You can buy a futures contract from your supplier to deliver a specific amount of rubber at a specific future delivery date at
an agreed price today. 
5. Fund Management
6. Lottery
7. Payments: Payment as streams of money and not transactions. :) 
8. Insurance: All of the tokens locked within smart contracts are potentially vulnerable to smart contract exploits due to the large potential payout possible. While most projects have gotten their codebases audited, we never know if the smart contracts are truly safe, and there is always a
possibility of a hack that may result in a loss. The risks highlight the need for purchasing insurance, especially if one deals with large amounts of funds on DeFi. We will explore several decentralized insurance options in this book.
9. Governance
