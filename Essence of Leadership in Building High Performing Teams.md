The image above encapsulates the essence of effective leadership in building high-performing teams.

In leading high-performing teams, the key attitude is to "serve your teams" so they can "serve customers."

This approach is logical because the leadership team is relatively small compared to the employee base. When all employees focus on serving customers, their collective performance will surpass that of a scenario where leadership alone attempts to fulfill this role.

The leadership team's role is to inspire, educate, and enable teams to serve customers. A good leadership team creates a system where teams are recognized for their customer service. Leaders should have a deep understanding of their customers, business goals, and processes for helping customers. Good leaders also lead by example, demonstrating care and concern for customers through their thought leadership.

High-performing team (HPT) leadership empowers teams to make decisions and trusts that they will act to satisfy customers. The leadership team should not become a bottleneck. Instead, it should provide the necessary tools, insights, data points, and an environment that fosters self-correction based on results.

An ineffective approach is for leaders to expect teams to serve them rather than the customers. Autocratic or authoritative leadership styles are not inherently bad. However, these become counterproductive when leaders prioritize their own service over the customers' needs.
