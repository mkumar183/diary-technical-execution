I think by virtue of being from India, i have been in an environment where i always had a layer of protection from US. I have worked on large products but i have not had full accountability of these large products. I have grabbed such accountabilities wherever i could. This is a weakness that i want to overcome. So i do have this fear if i have to manage such large products from India how would i do that. I have experimented and have done that for smaller products and smaller areas of products but still if you ask me, in most circumstances i have had someone in US to support these. 

Being far away from customers, my understanding of customer pain points and business is not as much as it should be. I am not in a position to say what we should build i wish i had opportunity to interact with more customers. My timezone does not allow me to do this. I try to study crayon research etc but that does not give me so much understanding. 

At times i get too much into details and that drifts me away from larger problems.

At times i start too many initiatives.
