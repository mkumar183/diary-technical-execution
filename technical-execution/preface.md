### Technical Execution in the context of a business problem solution organization 

##### Context: About Myself 
I am part of PowerSchool where we are engaged in solving problems for educational institutes especially K-12 schools and school districts. So we are essentially in a business of building small to medium size web applications that help teachers, administrators, students and parents. Education is important part of every human beings life. K-12 is a period of 12 years that kids spend in schools learning various skills. What they learn during this time is what makes them and determines their future. While industries are wide and there are so many skills all students are put through the same education system to perform in the industries at very different levels. 

This technical execution guide is from perspective of an organization which is of our size that deals with 30-40+ different applications and these applications are then used by a particular school district to run their day to day operations and gain efficiencies in their processes and provide best outcomes to their students, teachers, administrators and parents. 

###### Organize itself as separated Web Apps
Unlike organizations like Oracle or SAP that could build many business applications under the same technology and architectures, In these organizations we are faced with challenge of dealing with applications built using very different set of technologies and their architectures are different as well. Starting from the time these applications were built to the selection of technologies, cloud providers, deployment methodologies and monitoring / observability in the cloud each of these practices are different for these different applications. 

The major challenge we are faced with is how to integrate these applications and provide a seamless experience to our customers. 

###### How you organize yourself matters 
While each of these products were at one point of time established independently and are still functioning independently putting these into a flattened structure creates a bottleneck to growth of each application. Today we are organized as horizontal organizations made up of Engineering, Support, Services, Cloudops, Product Management etc. While each of these departments deal with all of 40-50+ product lines there is little in common in these. The communication across these departments becomes increasingly difficult. While each of these departments act more like 'COEs' they have something to benefit to be each other in terms of sharing best practices however, the context of each of these teams remain very different. Eventually, teams loose context of their own application and the customers and their needs.

###### A software company building a new application that will solve problems. 
###### Process of building a web application or a solution 
###### Process of upkeeping of an application 
###### Building the right culture 
###### Solving business problems


### 3 Broader categories of 'Software Organizations' 
1. One set of organizations that build applications that are for use of mass scale.
2. Set of organizations that build B2B applications that are generic in nature however, can be customized with services engagement for need of specific business need
3. Type 3 is organizations that exclusively serve specific clients and solve their business problems using technologies.

Even though all 3 types of organizations are so called 'Software Organizations' and develop softwares, the nature of work that occurs in each of these is different and as you get into technical execution of these projects, the style, methodologies used and systesm around these can be significantly different. 

Type 1: 
Organizations such as Microsoft, Google, Apple, Uber etc these are Type 1 organizations that build massive scale applications that can be used across all vertical industries. These are horizontal applications such as microsoft excel which are used by masses these are B2C applications mostly however, in some scenarios these do become B2B where in there are enterprise deals between these organizations to manage their work and applications. 

Type 2: 
Oracle, SAP, ERP players these companies build softwares for large businesses. These companies build the core of these systems that these businesses need plus provide a robust customization framework using which these organizations can build custom business logic or workflows that are required for them to sustain their businesses. 

Type 3: 
These are like Infosys, Satyam, TCS typically these organizations take tender to do the custom or any other type of work that these organizations need in order to sustain their businesses.
