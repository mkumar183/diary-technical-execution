This is a way to escape the curly braces in a YAML file. In Argo workflows, {{inputs.parameters.customer}} is a placeholder for a parameter named customer. However, if you want to include the literal text {{inputs.parameters.customer}} in a YAML file, you need to escape the curly braces.

In this case, the outer single quotes (') are used to denote a string. The {{ "{{" }} and {{ "}}" }} are Jinja2 templating syntax used to escape the inner curly braces.

So, '{{ "{{" }}inputs.parameters.customer{{ "}}" }}' will be rendered as {{inputs.parameters.customer}} in the final YAML.

This is often used when you're writing a YAML file that will be processed by a templating engine before it's used. The templating engine will replace the {{ "{{" }} and {{ "}}" }} with { and }, respectively, leaving you with {{inputs.parameters.customer}} in the processed YAML.
