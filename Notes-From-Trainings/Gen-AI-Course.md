1. Remember basics of Linear models, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning models 
2. LLMs are large language models where huge amount of text has been fed into it 
3. Similarly there are large models for images and audio 
4. LLMs / GenAI comparison to Parrots who are connected with all parrots in the world. 
5. Diffusion model : Blur images and un-blur images and understand clusters of pixels in the images 
6. GPT - Generative Pre-Trainied Transformer 
7. Reads enormous amount of data, clusters it and then arrives at a probability of next word possible out of all the data it has read. 
8. Foundational Model, Parrot Back. 

Prompt Engineering: 
- adverserial 
- generator , discriminator bats and moths -> adverserial evolutionary relationship 
- Generative Adverserial Networks: GANs 
- Self-supervised Learning => Unsupervised learning to create labels for data 
- Autoencoding -> Encode / Decode -> Feature extraction from images
- Extract features and put it in a latent space. Anomaly Extraction. 
- Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
- DALLe-2 Diffusion model 

Companies should try to create their own generation AI Model 
- Create a foundational Model 
- Technological Determinism
