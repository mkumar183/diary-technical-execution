My goal or dream is to always have multiple options available very handy to me for jobs. I carefully examine these options and make a call every 3 years to decide what i want to do and where i want to be. I do not want to be at the mercy of any employer. 

I want to be very calm and composed. My decisions of shifting are never going to be in hurry. These are always going to be within windows of at least 3 years. Once i decide to be there somewhere for next 3 years then i just commit to it and be there. Achieve those outcomes and then only think about these. 

I want to have enough financial backup so that i can decide to step out of a job and take a break for few weeks or months as desired. During these times i like to focus on certain objectives and areas of achievements.
