O Lord, Lead me from 
- Desires to Contentment
- Restlessness to Peach 
- Death to immortality 
- Unreal to Real 
- Darkness to light 
- Ignorance to wisdom


I am submerged in thy light, it permeates every particle of my being. I am living in that light. Divine Spirit fills me within and without. 

I relax and cast aside all mental burdens, allowing God to express through me His perfect love, peace, and wisdom.

“Whatever conditions confront me, I know that they represent the next step in my unfoldment. I welcome all tests, no matter how trying, because I know that within me is the intelligence to understand, and the power to overcome. I am willing to learn the lesson each experience can teach, and I am thankful for the strength and understanding developed by overcoming each trial.”

God is within and around me, protecting me; so I will banish the fear that shuts out His guiding light.

O Omnipresent Protector….In life and death, in disease, famine, pestilence, or poverty may I ever cling to Thee. Help me to realize I am immortal Spirit, untouched by the changes of childhood, youth, age, and world upheavals.

O Father, Thine unlimited and all healing power is in me. Manifest Thy light through the darkness of my ignorance. Wherever this healing light is present, there is perfection. Therefore, perfection is in me.

wherever i go whatever i do, may the searchlight of my mind and heart be always turned towards thee. 

I take a sacred vow: Never shall the sun gaze of my love sink below the horizon of my thought of thee. Never will i lower the vision of my lifted eyes to place it on aught but Thee. Never will i do anything that reminds me not of thee.
