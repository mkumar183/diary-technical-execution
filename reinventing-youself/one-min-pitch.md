## Three Pillars of Excellence

## Managing-Self 
The first pillar i would like to share is the pillar of managing self. I am a self disciplined person with focus of my life being on yoga-meditations. Though purpose of this is more spiritual than materialistic gains, this has significant impact on my personality and demeanor that has helped fuel my professional growth and i like to share with you. 
This has given me a strong executive presence since I am not someone who believes in gossips, and i am concerned about the profession and its growth. So in my day to day conversations with people i like to discuss and learn from them and have more inspiring conversations even though short. 
As i have grown in this dimension, i feel I am able to cultivate myself as a person who has more patience. I am able to work on my ego and become more humble day by day since that's the focus of my practices. I am also somebody whose personality trait is of type learning so i try to continuously improve myself everyday. I think, feel and have got confirmations from my collegues that i have become a person who gets angry seldom and is more calm. Though i am no where perfect in any of these. yet i can say, yes i am improving myself everyday. 
I have also become more emotionally intelligent and empathetic with people. e.g. i do not look at people as absolute even from performance angle rather i see are they making continuous improvement. 

Bringing a calm demeanor, strong executive presence, someone who does not believe in gossips, focused on work and joy in life, a strong sense of purpose in life and profession which is interlinked and is towards serving people, serving people attitude, non-compromising with values such as integrity and being upfront and honest, always thinking about the organization and not self-oriented, a pleasing, motivating, encouraging personality. believing in values such as continuous improvement, always trying to learn more from people and surrounding, sharing personal experiences and happiness with others and always striving to do more. high on patience and believing more in improvement than absolute state.  

## Passion for Technology
The second pillar i like to talk about is my passion for technology. I started my career way back in 1997 as an engineer working on cobol. From there i progressed working at Oracle where majority of my work was in SQL/PLSQL and solving critical business problems as well as performance challenges. Early in my career i dealt with numerous performance challenges by becoming a performance champion in my team. This was possible since i went deeper into how a technology like DBMS works at core level and how records are stored and how a SQL engine converts SQL Statements into a program to retrieve data. 
Over a period of time, my career has drawn me towards more backend related systems since i started building Analytics systems for various companies. 
I can say today proudly that i am very hands on with SQL and python. I have worked on numerous technologies and have managed teams working on PHP, Ruby on rails, React, Javascript, Java, SQL and python myself being hands on. I have been able to successfully manage teams and products using any kind of technology. 
In my last 7 years of career at PowerSchool, i dealt with acquisition and merger of 7 companies for whom i developed and created their center of excellence in India. I was involved in phenomenal journey of growth of PS from 50 engineers to 500 engineers today. Establishing strong hiring practices. 
My focus has always been 'curious' and that of 'understanding'. Based on this i always nudge my teams and people to focus on why and get to the root of the problems or understanding and don't leave a problem or a solution without understanding the root of it. 
My interest grew in Cloud (predominantly AWS) where i have managed products using dockers, k8s, argo, fluxcd, AWS Serverless technologies, AWS Batch, sqs, sns and so on.. I have managed teams implementing all of these services in my products. 
My interest also grew in architecture where i studied many books on these and one of the book and author that has impressed me the most is juvi lovel and his approach of building architecture which falls true to tests of time of evolution of a software rather than present state. 

The products i managed are of medium scale such as 3 million users and currently about 700 large customers with over 6 million students. 
At powerschool i was handed over most challenging products such as classroom and unified insight in my 7 years. 

hands-on with coding, specialized in backend technologies with basics of front end and end to end web applications, striving to learn from teams always whenever they face issues or resolve issues. asking questions and ability to break things down in steps and asking what happens in next steps. start from basics. not complicating things and trying to talk in simple terminologies. 

Learning through small experiments and small projects that i keep running or building and keep understanding and connecting dots how newer technologies work and differ from the traditional ones. 

As an engineer who has remained ***hands-on*** with coding throughout my career, I've maintained a close connection to the practical challenges and innovations that occur at the coalface of technology development. This hands-on experience has been instrumental in keeping me **grounded in the realities of software development**, allowing me to lead with empathy and understanding. My journey has spanned managing teams and **products across a wide variety of technologies and frameworks**, from Java, PHP, Python, .NET, SQL, to various database technologies and cloud platforms. This breadth of experience has endowed me with a diverse and robust understanding of technology, enabling me to navigate and leverage it effectively for strategic advantage.
**key-words: hands-on, grounded with realities, wide varieties of technologies and cloud platform, breadth of experience. diverse and robust understanding of technologies.** 

## Passion for building high performing engineering culture and teams. 


Under the umbrella of engineering culture, my passion lies in fostering environments of high trust and empowerment. I've championed principles such as "leave it better" and "clean coding practices," and have been a steadfast advocate for "test-driven development" and the philosophy of "deliver a day later with higher quality." My leadership has guided teams to define clear goals and objectives, enhancing their capability to deploy code into production confidently. This includes leveraging advanced practices like feature flags and blue-green deployments to ensure seamless transitions and minimal user disruption. Central to my approach is embedding DevOps as a foundational culture, with a strong focus on observability to maintain and improve system reliability and performance. This holistic strategy has been key to building self-managing, high-performance teams that excel in their delivery and innovation, underpinned by a shared vision of success.
**key-words: engineering-culture, foster high trust and empowerment, leave it better, clean coding, bring out passion, test-driven development, deliver a day later with higher quality, clear goals and objectives. devops culture, observability, end to end delivery and development** 

More focused on preventive than being reactive, encouraging asking why are we doing what we are doing ? increasing curiosity. Improving psychological safety in teams.
