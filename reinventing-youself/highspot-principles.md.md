## All In
*We know that achieving something amazing requires passion and dedication. We support each other and hold each other accountable to deliver our best.*
- ***Meetings**: Ensuring each of such meeting such as R&D Leaders meeting in India there is a roster and there is a person assigned to take care of the Agenda for that week. I encourage running stand ups by different people of the team provided they are trained on it. P0 Roster. A proper training. Incident Commander role being taken up by different personas. 
- We have a common charter, anyone can be woken up at any time of the day / night , in case of P0s. However, this could be rare since we have a team assigned for it. Its also responsibility of each individual / team to see that they are not the one who can only solve a problem. 

- One Team One Heart as a culture 
- **Team Accountability**. Team can hold an Individual Accountable. To outside stakeholder Team Shields the Individual and takes blame if ever. 
- **Passion and Dedication**: I build a system of record myself which provides me a clear view and points to discuss with different teams. It also make them accountable.


## Invent the Future: 
We pride ourselves in thinking big and inventing better ways to do things. We continually challenge ourselves and the status quo.

**Thinking Big: AI Innovation**: 
- Be a Platform Company. Partner in addition to build.
- Open up the platform using APIs rather than build UI/UX. 
- You are working on a paper to publish to CXOs on this. Need blessings of India CoE. 

Invent: Assessment Signature Generation. Move to Serverless and AWS Batch. 

## Details Matter
We obsess over the details and we iterate until we get them right.
- Unified User: Had to get into every single details 
- Kickboard SIS Sync : Details of every single step such as delete, update, created. Statuses. Which columns are we maintaining. 
- YET Date 
- Snowflake Migration Guide 
- Triage Time / Dev Cycle Times. 
- Doing one thing at a Time and running standups effectively

## Earn the Next Challenge
We focus on delivering stellar work. We believe that by doing so, we individually and collectively earn the opportunity to take on bigger and more important challenges.

- Scale, Quality, Understanding the rollout phases and planning accordingly
- Connected Intelligence work 
- Schoology 3 million concurrency 
- Schoology roster sync upgrade 
- Kickboard SIS Sync 

## Most Respectful Interaction
We engage with people respectfully and assume they have good intentions and thoughtful viewpoints.
- Dumb Question Incident 
- I understand challenge of each person. E.g. I know in the organization some times i see people think someone else's work is easy. Today, my collegue is facing challenge in Sales. And i supported him. We have a woman leader in QA. And at times, i see that some people do not respect that. And i have pitched in on many times to see that she is respected for what she brings to the table. Rest all others have to pitch in and fill the gap. She is a mother of two and has her own constraints. I have dealt with many women during their pregnancy and many individual with tough life situations and i have created space for them. At times, i see certain individuals in teams are not respected and i have interfered in those. To me, so long as an individual is sincere and putting his best efforts i think that person needs to be respected. In case a particular type of work is not suitable for it then we can change that work and find a better fit. 


## Collaborate Across Boundaries
We ignore the org chart to bring together the right people regardless of team, role, or level.
- There are P0 situations in one of the product which we were decommissioning. And for this product there was a security issue. I in that case had to call several experts across teams to be able to triage and look into it and provide necessary help. I went ahead and collected all these people. Today, In india floor i know broader set of people and in case there is a situation where i need to call diverse set of people i do not hesitate. 
- YET Process how you got people from various teams. 
- We have a daily standup meeting cross functional. This is required for this team and this is where everyone from all areas come together. I drive this meening. Have a board. 


## Open and Real
We provide candid and constructive feedback. We avoid politics and say what we really think.
- Recent example of Shemeem where i had to give him feedback on ownership of YET Process. He is expected to bring people together across different teams and get the documentation ready for it.
- Feedback to Vaidehi has been very open and real. I have conveyed to him his strengths and weakness and how i am going to leverage his strengths. However, he need not be scared or worried. 

## Learn it All, Not Know it All
We approach our business with intense curiosity and are not afraid to ask questions.
- When I joined this project. I asked this question of why snowflake migration ? 


## Invest Wisely
We constantly challenge the way we invest our time and resources, striving to maximize impact.


## Make it Happen
We act with urgency and are willing to move mountains.


## Enjoy the Ride
We want to spend our time engaging with people and doing work we truly enjoy. We take the time to celebrate achievements.
