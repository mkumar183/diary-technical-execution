#### Reduce Uncertainty
Uncertainty is the leading cause of missed estimations. It is important not to confuse the unknown with the uncertain. For example, while the exact day of my demise is unknown, it is far from uncertain, and a whole industry (life insurance) is based on the ability to estimate that date. While the estimation may not be precise when it comes to me specifically, the life insurance industry has sufficient customers to make it accurate enough.

When asking people to estimate, you should help them overcome their fear of estimations. Many may have had their poor estimations used against them in the past. You may even encounter refusal to estimate in the form of “I don’t know” or “Estimations never work.” Such attitudes may indicate fear of entrapment, or trying to avoid the effort of estimating, or being ignorant and inexperienced in estimation techniques, rather than a fundamental inability to estimate.

#### Confronted with the uncertain, take these steps:

1. Ask first for the **order of magnitude**: Is the activity more like a day, a week, a month, or a year? With the magnitude known, narrow it down using factor of 2 to zoom in. For example, if the answer to the first question was a month as the type of unit, ask if it is more like two weeks, one month, two months, or four months. The first answer rules out eight months (since that is more like a year as an order of magnitude), and it cannot be one week because that was not provided in the first place as an order of magnitude.

2. Make an explicit effort to **list the areas of uncertainty in the project and focus on estimating them**. Always break down large activities into smaller, more manageable activities to greatly increase the accuracy of the estimations.

3. Invest in an **exploratory discovery effort** that will give insight into the nature of the problem and reduce the uncertainty. Review the history of the team or the organization, and learn from your own history how long things have taken in the past.
